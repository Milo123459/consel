**Consel**<br>
Consel - An extension to commands.<br><br>
**Why?**
Finding out how long executing tasks is annoying, so consel comes in and allows you to do that!<br>
**But wait, is this global?**<br>
Yeah, It's global, you can install with the following command:
```bash
$ npm i -g consel
``` 
**Oh one more thing, is it hard to use or configure?**<br>
Not in the slightest, just simply say `consel` in your terminal and you are up and running.<br>
**How do I update?**<br>
consel comes with a built in updater, so all you have to do is: `consel -u`. A few seconds later, consel will be updated.<br>
**How often are updates?**<br>
Usually every week, so make sure to constantly update!<br>
Thanks ;)
